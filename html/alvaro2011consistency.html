<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Strong consistency eases reasoning about distributed systems, but it requires coordination which entails higher latency and unavailability. Adopting weaker consistency models can improve system performance but writing applications against these weaker guarantees can be nuanced, and programmers don’t have any reasoning tools at their disposal. This paper introduces the <em>CALM conjecture</em> and <em>Bloom</em>, a disorderly declarative programming language based on CALM, which allows users to write loosely consistent systems in a more principled way.</p>
<p>Say we’ve eschewed strong consistency, how do we know our program is even eventually consistent? For example, consider a distributed register in which servers accept writes on a first come first serve basis. Two clients could simultaneously write two distinct values <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> concurrently. One server may receive <code>x</code> then <code>y</code>; the other <code>y</code> then <code>x</code>. This system is not eventually consistent. Even after client requests have quiesced, the distributed register is in an inconsistent state. The <em>CALM conjecture</em> embraces Consistency As Logical Monotonicity and says that logically monotonic programs are eventually consistent for any ordering and interleaving of message delivery and computation. Moreover, they do not require waiting or coordination to stream results to clients.</p>
<p><em>Bud</em> (Bloom under development) is the realization of the CALM theorem. It is Bloom implemented as a Ruby DSL. Users declare a set of Bloom collections (e.g. persistent tables, temporary tables, channels) and an order independent set of declarative statements similar to Datalog. Viewing Bloom through the lens of its procedural semantics, Bloom execution proceeds in timesteps, and each timestep is divided into three phases. First, external messages are delivered to a node. Second, the Bloom statements are evaluated. Third, messages are sent off elsewhere. Bloom also supports modules and interfaces to improve modularity.</p>
<p>The paper also implements a key-value store and shopping cart using Bloom and uses various visualization tools to guide the design of coordination-free implementations.</p>
