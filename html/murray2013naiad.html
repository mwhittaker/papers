<p>Naiad is a data-parallel dataflow framework that supports <em>low-latency</em>, <em>high throughput</em>, <em>iterative and incremental computations</em>, and <em>consistent intermediate results</em>. There are a lot of batch processing systems, stream processing systems, graph processing systems, etc. out there. Most of these systems satisfy most of these properties. Naiad achieves <em>all</em> of them in a single system making things more efficient, succinct, and maintainable. Naiad uses a new computation model, <em>timely dataflow</em>, which includes the following features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>structured loops which allow iterative computation and feedback,</li>
<li>stateful vertices, and</li>
<li>vertex notifications for the end of a epoch or the end of an iteration.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Timely Dataflow.</strong> Computation in the timely dataflow model is expressed as a directed, possibly cyclic graph of stateful vertices and edges that deliver messages. Messages are annotated with logical timestamps that allow vertices to distinguish messages from different epochs and loop iterations. Moreover, vertices are notified when all of the messages of a given timestamp have been delivered.</p>
<p><em>Graph Structure.</em> A timely dataflow graph has specially designated <em>input vertices</em> and <em>output vertices</em>. Inputs are pumped into the input vertices by an external system, and all inputs are tagged with an epoch. The output vertices pump outputs to an external system, and they also tag outputs with epochs.</p>
<p>Timely dataflow graphs can contain cycles, but not arbitrary cycles. Cycles must be organized into possibly nested structures called <em>loop contexts</em>. Each loop context contains three specially designated vertices:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>an <em>ingress vertex</em> at the beginning of the loop,</li>
<li>an <em>egress vertex</em> at the end of the loop, and</li>
<li>a <em>feedback vertex</em> along a cycle within the loop context.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each message in a timely dataflow is labelled with a logical timestamp of the form <code>(e, (c_1, ..., c_k))</code> where <code>e</code> is an epoch and <code>(c_1, ..., c_k)</code> is a list of <code>k</code> loop counters. As data flows through a loop context, the three special nodes adjust the timestamp as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>ingress: <code>(e, &lt;c_1, ..., c_k&gt;) -&gt; (e, &lt;c_1, ..., c_k, 0&gt;)</code></li>
<li>egress: <code>(e, &lt;c_1, ..., c_k, c_{k+1}&gt;) -&gt; (e, &lt;c_1, ..., c_k&gt;)</code></li>
<li>feedback: <code>(e, &lt;c_1, ..., c_k&gt;) -&gt; (e, &lt;c_1, ..., c_k + 1&gt;)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Timestamps are compared pairwise and loop counters are compared lexicographically.</p>
<p><em>Vertex Computation.</em> Vertices implement two callbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>v.OnRecv(e: Edge, m: Message, t: Timestamp)</code></li>
<li><code>v.OnNotify(t: Timestamp)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and can invoke two library functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>this.SendBy(e: Edge, m: Message, t: Timestamp)</code></li>
<li><code>this.NotifyAt(t: Timestamp)</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>OnRecv</code> is called when a message is received. <code>SendBy</code> is used to send a message. <code>v.NotifyAt(t)</code> causes a <code>v.OnNotify(t)</code> timestamp to be called later once all messages with timestamp less than or equal to <code>t</code> have been delivered. <code>OnRecv</code> and <code>OnNotify</code> can run arbitrary code so long as they don’t send messages back in time.</p>
<p><em>Achieving Timely Dataflow.</em> Here, we outline how to implement timely dataflow in a single-threaded process. Let an <em>event</em> be a message or notification request. Each event in a timely dataflow has a position and timestamp, dubbed a <em>pointsamp</em>, of the form <code>(t: Timestamp, l: Edge | Vertex)</code>. Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>v.SendBy(e, m, t)</code> produces an event with pointstamp <code>(t, e)</code>, and</li>
<li>a <code>v.NotifyAt(t)</code> produces an event with pointstamp <code>(t, v)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Define a <em>could-result-in</em> relation where <code>(t1, l1)</code> could-result-in <code>(t1, l2)</code> if there exists a path of vertices and edges <code>psi = (l1, ..., l2)</code> where <code>psi(t1) &lt;= t2</code>. That is, there is some path from <code>l1</code> to <code>l2</code> which updates <code>t1</code> to a timestamp less than <code>t2</code>. There may be multiple paths from <code>l1</code> to <code>l2</code>, so the system maintains a map <code>Psi[l1, l2]</code> of the minimum path.</p>
<p>Our single-threaded timely dataflow scheduler maintains a set of <em>active pointstamps</em>: the set of pointstamps for which there is a pending event. Each active pointstamp is mapped to an <em>occurrence count</em> (the number of pending events with this particular pointstamp) and a <em>precursor count</em> (the number of active pointstamps that could-result-in this one). When an new pending event is created, the occurrence count is updated and it’s initial precursor count is created. Moreover, the precursor counts of downstream nodes are updated. All nodes with a precursor count of 0 are said to be on the frontier, and the system can deliver notifications on the frontier. Finally, input vertices set up the appropriate active pointstamps which update as data is fed into the system.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed Implementation.</strong> Naiad is a distributed implementation of the timely dataflow model. Like other batch and stream processing systems, Naiad uses data parallelism to increase the aggregate computation, memory, and bandwidth of the system. A logical dataflow graph is compiled and expanded a physical dataflow graph which includes physical details like the partitioning along each edge.</p>
<p>Workers are responsible for delivering the messages and notifications to the vertices it runs. Each vertex is run single-threaded, and if a vertex sends a message to anther vertex in the same worker, the worker can immediately transfer control between the two vertexes. Vertexes can specify a level of re-entrancy but are otherwise assumed to be non-reentrant.</p>
<p>Workers also participate in a global progress tracking protocol. Workers maintain local occurrence and precursor counts. When a worker invokes one of the four functions above, it broadcasts updates to the occurrence counts. The protocol maintains the invariant that if some pointstamp <code>p</code> is on the local frontier at a vertex, it is on the global frontier as well. As an optimization, the active pointstamps are maintained on the global graph instead of the physical graph. Deltas are also accumulated and buffered.</p>
<p>For fault tolerance, stateful vertices implement <code>Checkpoint</code> and <code>Restore</code> methods. Naiad uses these to orchestrate global checkpoints and restorations.</p>
<p>Micro-stragglers—nodes with unusually high latency—are the main obstacle for a low-latency system. Micro-stragglers can come about from TCP overheads, data structure contention, garbage collection etc. Naiad has mechanisms to mitigate these micro-stragglers.</p>
<p><strong>Writing Naiad Programs.</strong> Naiad provides lower-level interfaces for constructing timely dataflow graphs. Higher-level libraries and interfaces (e.g. SQL, LINQ) can be built on top of this lower-level interface. This separation of library code from system code allows for greater flexibility.</p>
