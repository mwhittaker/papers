<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Virtual machines have become increasingly popular in cloud and cluster environments. In these environments, VM migration—the process in which a virtual machine running on one physical machine is migrated to run on another physical machine—is incredibly useful. For example, it allows cluster administrators to migrate VMs off of a machine before decommisioning it for repair. In this paper, the authors present their live migration scheme that allows them to migrate Xen virtual machines with a very small amount of downtime.</p>
<p>A key step in migrating a virtual machine is migrating its memory. There are typically three phases of memory migration:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Push</em>. In the push phase, the migrating VM is up and running while pages of memory are pushed to the new physical machine.</li>
<li><em>Stop-and-copy</em>. In the stop-and-copy phase, the VM is stopped, its state is transfered along with any pages that weren’t pushed, and the VM is then started on the new machine.</li>
<li><em>Pull</em>. In the pull phase, the VM is running on the new machine and pages from the old machine are faulted over.</li>
</ol>
<p>A pure stop-and-copy approach is simple, but has down times proportional to the number of memory. A pure demand-migration scheme has small downtime but makes VMs slow until enough pages have been shipped over. This paper uses an iterative pre-copy scheme:</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Pre-migration.</em> Before migration, assume a VM is running on host A.</li>
<li><em>Reservation.</em> Resources are reserved on host B.</li>
<li><em>Iterative pre-copy.</em> Memory from host A is iteratively copied to host B. The pages copied in one round are the pages that were dirtied since the last round.</li>
<li><em>Stop-and-copy.</em> The VM is stopped on host A and the remaining state and memory is sent to host B.</li>
<li><em>Commitment.</em> Host B confirms that it has received everything correctly and tells host A it is free to destroy itself.</li>
<li><em>Activation.</em> Host B starts the VM.</li>
</ol>
<p>The migration scheme also performs some ARP tricks to transfer the IP address of the machines. Note that local disk copying is not included in this paper.</p>
<p>Imagine a VM that never writes any memory. Then a single iteration of pre-copying is sufficient. Alternatively, assume a VM dirties every page of memory at a rate faster than pre-copying. Then, pre-copying could carry on indefinitely. Most programs lie within these two extremes. The amount of memory they quickly write is dubbed the <em>writable working set</em> (WWS). The paper performs some experiments showing the size of the WWS for various benchmarks.</p>
<p>There are two ways to implement VM migration:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Managed Migration.</em> In managed migration, VM migration is managed by migration daemons running in dom0 of each machine. Xen inserts a shadow page table underneath the operating system. It marks all the pages in the OS’s page table as read-only. Then, when an OS goes to write the page, the machine traps into Xen which marks the page as writeable and notes that the page was dirtied. After each round of pre-copying, the shadow page table and dirty bits are reset. When pre-copying is done, Xen notifies the OS to get ready to be migrated, then ships over the last bits of state.</li>
<li><em>Self Migration.</em> In self migration, each OS is responsible for migrating itself. Iterative pre-copy is performed as before. Now, stop-and-copy is performed in two phases to allow an OS to stop itself while still running.</li>
</ol>
<p>A higher transfer bandwidth reduces the downtime of migration but interferes with active services running on the machines. Conversely, a lower transfer bandwidth increases the downtime of migration but does not interfere as much with active services. This paper uses a dynamic rate limiting scheme. An administrator sets a lower and upper bandwidth limit. Transfer begins at the lower limit. The next iteration uses the estimated page dirtying rate from the last round plus a constant. This process terminates when the upper limit is reached or there is not much memory left to transfer. Moreover, pages that are repeatedly dirtied are not pre-copied.</p>
<p>Migration can also take advantage of paravirtualization. OSes can sleep processes that write a lot, and they can report which pages are free to Xen to limit a full memory scan.</p>
