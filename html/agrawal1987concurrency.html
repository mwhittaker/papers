<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>There are three types of concurrency control algorithms: locking algorithms, timestamp based algorithms, optimistic algorithms. There have been a large number of performance analyses aimed at deciding which type of concurrency algorithm is best, however despite the abundance of analyses, there is no definitive winner. Different analyses have contradictory results, largely because there is no standard performance model or set of assumptions. This paper presents a complete database model for evaluating the performance of concurrency control algorithms and discusses how varying assumptions affect the performance of various algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="performance-model">Performance Model</h2>
<p>This paper analyzes three specific concurrency control mechanisms,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blocking.</strong> Transactions acquire locks before they access a data item. Whenever a transaction acquires a lock, deadlock detection is run. If a deadlock is detected, the youngest transaction is aborted.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate-restart.</strong> Again, transactions acquire locks, but instead of blocking if a lock cannot be immediately acquired, the transaction is instead aborted and restarted with delay. This delay is adjusted dynamically to be roughly equal to the average transaction duration.</li>
<li><strong>Optimistic.</strong> Transactions do not acquire locks. A transaction is aborted when it goes to commit if it read any objects that had been written and committed since the transaction began.</li>
</ul>
<p>using a closed queueing model of a single-site database. Essentially, transactions come in, sit in some queues, and are controlled by a concurrency control algorithm. The model has a number of parameters, some of which are held constant for all the experiments and some of which are varied from experiment to experiment. Some of the parameters had to be tuned to get interesting result. For example, it was found that with a large database and few conflicts, all concurrency control algorithms performed roughly the same and scaled with the degree of parallelism.</p>
<h2 id="resource-related-assumptions">Resource-Related Assumptions</h2>
<p>Some analyses assume infinite resources. How do these assumptions affect concurrency control performance?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment 1: Infinite Resources.</strong> Given infinite resources, higher degrees of parallelism lead to higher likelihoods of transaction conflict which in turn leads to higher likelihoods of transaction abort and restart. The blocking algorithm thrashes because of these increased conflicts. The immediate-restart algorithm plateaus because the dynamic delay effectively limits the amount of parallelism. The optimistic algorithm does well because aborted transactions are immediately replaced with other transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment 2: Limited Resources.</strong> With a limited number of resources, all three algorithms thrash, but blocking performs best.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment 3: Multiple Resources.</strong> The blocking algorithm performs best up to about 25 resource units (i.e. 25 CPUs and 50 disks); after that, the optimistic algorithm performs best.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment 4: Interactive Workloads.</strong> When transactions spend more time “thinking”, the system begins to behave more like it has infinite resources and the optimistic algorithm performs best.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="transaction-behavior-assumptions">Transaction Behavior Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment 6: Modeling Restarts.</strong> Some analyses model a transaction restart as the spawning of a completely new transaction. These fake restarts lead to higher throughput because they avoid repeated transaction conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment 7: Write-Lock Acquisition.</strong> Some analyses have transactions acquire read-locks and then upgrade them to write-locks. Others have transactions immediately acquire write-locks if the object will ever be written to. Upgrading locks can lead to deadlock if two transactions concurrently write to the same object. The effect of lock upgrading varies with the amount of available resources.</li>
</ul>
