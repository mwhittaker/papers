<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Public clouds like Amazon’s EC2 or Google’s Compute Engine allow users to elastically spawn a huge number virtual machines on a huge number of physical machines. However, spawning a VM can take on the order of minutes, and typically spawned VMs are launched in some static initial state. SnowFlock implements the VM fork abstraction, in which a parent VM forks a set of children VMs all of which inherit a snapshot of the parent. Moreover, SnowFlock implements this abstraction with subsecond latency. A subsecond VM fork implementation can be used for sandboxing, parallel computation (the focus of this paper), load handling, etc.</p>
<p>SnowFlock is built on top of Xen. Specifically, it is a combination of modifications to the Xen hypervisor and a set of daemons running in dom0 which together forms a distributed system that manages virtual machine forking. Guests use a set of calls (i.e. <code>sf_request_ticket</code>, <code>sf_clone</code>, <code>sf_join</code>, <code>sf_kill</code>, and <code>sf_exit</code>) to request resources on other machines, fork children, wait for children, kill children, and exit from a child. This implies that applications must be modified. SnowFlock implements the forking mechanism and leaves policy to pluggable cluster framework management software.</p>
<p>SnowFlock takes advantage of four insights with four distinct implementation details.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>VMs can get very large, on the order of a couple of GBs. Copying these images between physical machines can saturate the network, and even when implemented using things like multicast, can still be slow. Thus, SnowFlock must reduce the amount of state transfered between machines. SnowFlock takes advantage of the fact that a newly forked VM doesn’t need the entire VM image to start running. Instead, SnowFlock uses <em>VM Descriptors</em>: a condensed VM image that consists of VM metadata, a few memory pages, registers, a global descriptor table, and page tables. When a VM is forked, a VM descriptor for it is formed and sent to the children to begin running.</li>
<li>When a VM is created from a VM descriptor, it doesn’t have all the memory it needs to continue executing. Thus, memory must be sent from the parent when it is first accessed. Parent VMs use copy-on-write to maintain an immutable copy of memory at the point of the snapshot. Children use Xen shadow pages to trap accesses to pages not yet present and request them from the parent VM.</li>
<li>Sometimes VMs access memory that they don’t really need to get from the parent. SnowFlock uses two <em>avoidance heuristics</em> to avoid the transfer overhead. First, if new memory is being allocated (often indirectly through a call to something like malloc), the memory contents are not important and do not need to be paged in from the parent. A similar optimization is made for buffers being written to by devices.</li>
<li>Finally, parent and children VMs often access the same code and data. SnowFlock takes advantage of this data locality by prefetching; when one child VM requests a page of memory, the parent multicasts it to all children.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, the same copy-on-write techniques to maintain an immutable snapshot of memory are used on the disk. And, the parent and children virtual machines are connected by a virtual subnet in which each child is given an IP address based on its unique id.</p>
