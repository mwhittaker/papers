<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Writing distributed Internet applications is difficult because they have to serve a huge number of requests, and the number of requests is highly variable and bursty. Moreover, the applications themselves are also complicated pieces of code. This paper introduces the <em>staged event-driven architecture</em> (SEDA) which has the following goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Massive concurrency.</em> Applications written using SEDA should be able to support a very large number of clients.</li>
<li><em>Simplify the construction of well-conditioned services.</em> A <em>well-conditioned</em> service is one that gracefully degrades. Throughput increases with the number of clients until it saturates at some threshold. At this point, throughput remains constant and latency increases proportionally with the number of clients. SEDA is designed to make writing well-conditioned services easy.</li>
<li><em>Enable introspection.</em> SEDA applications should be able to inspect and adapt to incoming request queues. Some request-per-thread architectures, for example, do not enable introspection. Control over thread scheduling is left completely to the OS; it cannot be adapted to the queue of incoming requests.</li>
<li><em>Self-tuning resource management.</em> SEDA programmers should not have to tune knobs themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>SEDA accomplishes these goals by structuring applications as a <em>network</em> of <em>event-driven stages</em> connected by <em>explicit message queues</em> and managed by <em>dynamic resource controllers</em>. That's a dense sentence, so let's elaborate.</p>
<p>Threading based concurrency models have scalability limitations due to the overheads of context switching, poor caching, synchronization, etc. The <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-events.pdf">event-driven concurrency model</a> involves nothing more than a single-threaded loop that reads messages and processes them. It avoids many of the scalability limitations that threading models face. In SEDA, the atomic unit of execution is a <em>stage</em> and is implemented using an event-driven concurrency model. Each stage has an input queue of messages which are read in batches by a thread pool and processed by a user-provided event handler which can in turn write messages to other stages.</p>
<p>A SEDA application is simply a network (i.e. graph) of interconnected stages. Notably, the input queue of every stage is finite. This means that when one stage tries to write data to the input queue of another stage, it may fail. When this happens, stages have to block (i.e. pushback), start dropping requests (i.e. load shedding), degrade service, deliver an error to the user, etc.</p>
<p>To ensure SEDA applications are well-conditioned, various resource managers tune SEDA application parameters to ensure consistent performance. For example, the <em>thread pool controller</em> scales the number of threads within stages based on the number of messages in its input queue. Similarly, the <em>batching controller</em> adjusts the size of the batch delivered to each event handler.</p>
<p>The authors developed a SEDA prototype in Java dubbed Sandstorm. As with all event-driven concurrency models, Sandstorm depends on asynchronous I/O libraries. It implements asynchronous network I/O as three stages using existing OS functionality (i.e. select/poll). It implements asynchronous file I/O using a dynamically resizable thread pool that issues synchronous calls; OS support for asynchronous file I/O was weak at the time. The authors evaluate Sandstorm by implementing and evaluating an HTTP server and Gnutella router.</p>
