<p>Databases experience anomalous load in many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hot Spots.</strong> Sometimes, a small <em>minority</em> of the tuples in the database account for a large <em>majority</em> of the load.</li>
<li><strong>Time-Varying Skew.</strong> Load is sometimes diurnal (i.e. large in the day, small at night) or seasonal (e.g. large around Christmas).</li>
<li><strong>Load Spikes.</strong> Sometimes, predictable or unpredictable events cause a huge increase in load (e.g. a game winning touchdown in the Superbowl).</li>
<li><strong>Hockey Stick Effect.</strong> Startups sometimes experience an exponential growth rate leading to an exponential increase in load.</li>
</ul>
<p>E-Store is an distributed elastic OLTP RDBMs built on top of H-Store that can handle varying load by (a) adding and removing nodes and (b) moving tuples between nodes.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>Distributed transactions are much slower than local transactions, so any sort of data movement to balance load must be careful not to accidentally increase the number of distributed transactions and end up increasing the load. E-Store defers this consideration for future work. We assume that all relations follow a tree-schema pattern and accesses are all root-to-leaf. The root relation is partitioned by key, and each root tuple is co-located with all its descendants.</p>
<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a Nutshell</h2>
<p>There are three components to elasticity:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>How to detect load imbalance.</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to choose which data to move and where to move it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to physically move the data.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For (1), E-Store uses a novel two-phase monitoring scheme in which a coarse-grained load measurement triggers a finer-grained tuple-level access profile. For (2), E-Store uses a novel two-tiered partitioning scheme in which data is moved at two granularities: hot tuples and cold chunks. For (3), E-Store uses a modified version of an existing tool named Squall.</p>
<h2 id="data-migration">Data Migration</h2>
<p>To migrate data, E-Store uses a modified version of an existing tool named Squall. Squall takes in a <strong>reconfiguration plan</strong> which describes which data should go where. It divides the plan into subplans and then executes the subplans in an order that prioritizes moving data from the most loaded server to the least loaded server. It also allows transactions to be placed between subplans to avoid stalling the system. It also takes care to make sure that running transactions are not disrupted by the movement.</p>
<h2 id="tiered-partitioning">2-Tiered Partitioning</h2>
<p>Typically, data in an RDBMs is range or hash partitioned in units of blocks. These blocks are then migrated between nodes. E-Store has two tiers of partitioning. First, it range partitions root keys into blocks of <code>B</code> tuples. Second, it extracts the top <code>k</code> hot tuples from the blocks and migrates them individually.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h2>
<p>In order to partition at tuple granularity, E-Store has to know which tuples are hot. Counting tuple-level accesses can be prohibitively expensive, so E-Store uses a two-phase approach. First, E-Store gathers OS-level load from all nodes. If the load drops below a low watermark or exceeds a high watermark, the second phase is triggered. In the second phase, the database records the total number of tuple accesses on each node, and the top <code>k</code> hottest tuple on each node along with their access counts. This information is used by the reprovisioning algorithms which determine where to move which tuples.</p>
<h2 id="reprovisioning">Reprovisioning</h2>
<p>E-Store (a) adds and removes nodes and (b) moves tuples around.</p>
<p>For (a), if the load decreases the low watermark, nodes are removed from the system. If the load exceeds the high watermark, nodes are added to the system.</p>
<p>For (b), we can make a perfect decision using a integer linear program. The program has an indicator variable for <code>x_ij</code> to assign each hot tuple <code>i</code> to node <code>j</code> and an indicator variable <code>y_ij</code> to assign every cold block <code>i</code> to node <code>j</code>. Constraints ensure that assignments make sense, load is balanced, and not too many tuples are moved.</p>
<p>The integer linear program solves the problem exactly, but is expensive. E-Store uses a couple of approximation algorithms to approximate the integer linear program solution.</p>
