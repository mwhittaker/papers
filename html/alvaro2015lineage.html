<p>Building fault tolerant systems is hard, like really hard. There are are a couple approaches to building fault-tolerant systems, but none are perfect.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <em>bottom-up</em> approach, we verify individual components of a system are fault-tolerant and then glue the components together. Unfortunately, fault-tolerance is not closed under composition: the combination of two fault-tolerant systems may not be fault tolerant.</li>
<li>In a <em>top-down</em>, we can inject faults into an existing system and see whether or not it fails. Fault-injection can discover shallow bugs, but has trouble surfacing bugs that require more complex failure scenarios (e.g. a network partition followed by a particular sequence of machine failures).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lineage-driven Fault Injection</strong> (LDFI) is a top-down approach which uses lineage and fault injection to carefully discover fault-tolerance bugs in distributed systems. If a bug is found, the lineage of the bug is given to the user to help discover the root cause of the bug. If no bugs are found, LDFI provides some guarantees that there are no possible bugs for that particular configuration.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, LDFI takes a program written in something like Bloom, inputs to the program, and some parameters (e.g. to bound the length the execution, to bound the number of faults, etc.). It runs the given program on the given input and computes a provenance graph of the output. It then carefully selects a small number of faults that invalidate every derivation. It then injects these faults into the system to see if it surfaces a bug. This is repeated until a bug is found or no such bugs exist.</p>
<p>In this paper, Alvaro presents LDFI and an LDFI implementation named <strong>Molly</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="system-model">System Model</h2>
<p>LDFI injects faults, but not every kind of fault. We'll explore dropped messages, failed nodes, and network partitions. We <em>won't</em> explore message reordering or crash recovery. While we sacrifice generality, we gain tractability.</p>
<p>LDFI is governed by three parameters:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>LDFI does not operate over arbitrarily long executions. A parameter <strong>EOT</strong> (end of time) prescribes the maximum logical time of any execution examined by LDFI.</li>
<li>Distributed systems typically tolerate some number of faults, but cannot possible tolerate complete message loss for example. A parameter <strong>EFF</strong> (end of finite failures) &lt; EOT sets a logical time after which LDFI will not introduce faults. The time between EFF and EOT allows a distributed system to recover from message losses.</li>
<li>A parameter <strong>Crashes</strong> sets an upper limit on the number of node crashes LDFI will consider.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <strong>failure specification</strong> is a three-tuple (EOT, EFF, Crashes). Molly will automatically find a good failure specification by repeatedly increasing EOT until programs can create meaningful results and increasing EFF until faults occur.</p>
<p>We assume programs are written in Dedalus and that pre- and postconditions are expressed as special relations <code>pre</code> and <code>post</code> in the program.</p>
<h2 id="ldfi">LDFI</h2>
<p>Consider an interaction between Molly and a user trying to implement a fault-tolerant broadcast protocol between three nodes <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code> where <code>A</code> begins with a message to broadcast. Our correctness condition asserts that if a message is delivered to any non-failed node, it is delivered to all of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementation 1.</strong> Assume a user writes an incredibly naive broadcast protocol in which <code>A</code> sends a copy of the message to <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> once. Molly drops the message from <code>A</code> to <code>B</code> inducing a bug.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation 2.</strong> The author user then amends the program so that <code>A</code> continually sends the message to <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>. Molly drops the message from <code>A</code> to <code>B</code> and then crashes <code>A</code>. <code>C</code> has the message but <code>B</code> doesn't: a bug.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation 3.</strong> The author then amends the program so that all three nodes continuously broadcast the message. Now, Molly cannot find a set of dropped messages or node crashes to prevent all three nodes from obtaining the message.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation 4.</strong> While implementation 3 is fault-tolerant it is also inefficient. The user amends the protocol so that nodes broadcast messages until they receive an ack from the other nodes. Molly can devise a sequence of message drops and node crashes to prevent the message from being delivered to all three nodes, but when it runs the system again with the same faults, the messages still appear.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation 5.</strong> A &quot;classic&quot; implementation of broadcast in which a node broadcasts any message it receives once is found to be buggy by Molly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="molly">Molly</h2>
<p>Molly begins by rewriting a Dedalus program into a Datalog program.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each relation is augmented with a time column.</p>
<pre><code>foo(A,B) ==&gt; foo(A,B,T)
foo(B,C) ==&gt; bar(B,C,T)
baz(A,C) ==&gt; baz(A,C,T)</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The time column of every predicate in the body of a rule is bound to the same variable <code>T</code>.</p>
<pre><code>_ :- foo(A,B),   bar(B,C) ==&gt;
_ :- foo(A,B,T), bar(B,C,T)</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The head of every deductive rule is bound to <code>T</code>.</p>
<pre><code>baz(A,C)   :- foo(A,B),   bar(B,C) ==&gt;
baz(A,C,T) :- foo(A,B,T), bar(B,C,T)</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The head of every inductive rule is bound to <code>T + 1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>baz(A,C)     :- foo(A,B),   bar(B,C) ==&gt;
baz(A,C,T+1) :- foo(A,B,T), bar(B,C,T)</code></pre></li>
<li><p>For asynchronous rules, we introduce a <code>Clock(From, To, T)</code> relation which contains an entry <code>(n, m, T)</code> if node <code>n</code> sent a message to <code>m</code> at time <code>T</code>. Then, the body of asynchronous rules at node <code>n</code> whose heads are destined for node <code>n</code> are augmented with a <code>Clock(n, m, t)</code> predicate while the head is augmented with <code>T + 1</code>. Molly can add and remove entries from <code>Clock</code> to simulate faults.</p>
<pre><code>foo(A,B)     :- foo(B,A) ==&gt;
foo(A,B,T+1) :- foo(B,A,T), Clock(B,A,T)</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>It then rewrites the Datalog program to maintain its own provenance graph, and extracts lineage from the graph via recursive queries that walk the graph.</p>
<p>Given an execution of the Datalog program, Molly generates a CNF formula where the disjuncts inside each conjunct <code>x1 or .. or xn</code> represent a message drop or node failure that would invalidate a particular derivation. If all derivations can be invalidated, then the formula is unsatisfiable and the program is fault-tolerant. If the formula is satisfiable, then each satisfied conjunct represents a counterexample of the derivation. Molly uses a SMT solver to solve these formulas.</p>
