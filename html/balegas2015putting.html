<h2><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12926058981780664697&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5">Putting Consistency Back into Eventual Consistency (2015)</a></h2>

<p>Many distributed databases geo-replicate data for (i) lower read latency and
(ii) higher fault tolerance in the face of an extreme failure (e.g. <a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/compute/15056">lightning
striking a data
center</a>). Implementing
strong consistency over a geo-replicated system can incur tremendous write
latency, as updates have to coordinate between geographically distant data
centers. On the other hand, weak consistency is a real brain buster. This paper
introduces a new consistency model between weak and strong consistency,
<em>explicit consistency</em>, which takes into account user specified invariants. It
also presents an explicitly consistent system which</p>

<ol>
<li>performs static analysis to determine which operations can be executed
without coordination,</li>
<li>uses <em>invariant-repair</em> or <em>violation-avoidance</em> to resolve or avoid
conflicts, and</li>
<li>instruments user code with calls to middleware.</li>
</ol>

<p>The system is called <em>Indigo</em> and is built on an existing causally consistent
key-value store with various properties.</p>

<p><strong>Explicit Consistency.</strong>
A database is a collection of objects replicated across data centers. Users
issue reads and writes as part of transactions, and these transactions are
asynchronously replicated between data centers. We denote by <code>t(S)</code> the
database state achieved by applying transaction <code>t</code> to database state <code>S</code>.
<code>S_n</code> is the database state achieved after the <code>n</code>th transaction. That is, <code>S_n
= t_n(...(t_1(t_init))...)</code>. <code>T(S_n) = {t_1, ..., t_n}</code> is the set of
transactions used to create <code>S_n</code>. We say a transaction <code>t_a</code> happens before a
transaction <code>t_b</code>, denoted <code>t_a --&gt; t_b</code>, if <code>t_a</code> is in <code>T(S_b)</code>. <code>O = (T,
--&gt;)</code> is a partial order. <code>O' = (T, &lt;)</code> is a serialization of <code>O</code> if <code>&lt;</code> is
total and respects <code>--&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Given an invariant <code>I</code>, we say <code>S</code> is <code>I</code>-valid if <code>I(S) = true</code>. <code>(T, &lt;)</code> is
an <code>I</code>-valid serialization if <code>I</code> holds on all prefixes of the serialization.
If a system ensures that all serializations are <code>I</code>-valid, it provides explicit
consistency. In other words, an explicitly consistent database ensures
invariants always hold. This builds off of Bailis et al.'s notion of
invariant-confluence.</p>

<p><strong>Determining I-offender Sets.</strong>
An <em>invariant</em> is a universally quantified first order logic formula in prenex
normal form. The invariant can include uninterpreted functions like <code>Player(P)</code>
and <code>enrolled(P, T)</code>.</p>

<p>A <em>postcondition</em> states how operations affect the truth values of the
uninterpreted functions in invariants. Every operation is annotated with
postconditions. A <em>predicate clause</em> directly alters the truth assignments of a
predicate (e.g. not <code>Player(P)</code>). A <em>function clause</em> relates old and new
database states (e.g. <code>nrPlayers(T) = nrPlayers(T) + 1</code>).</p>

<p>This language is rather expressive, as evidenced by multiple examples in the
paper.</p>

<p>A set of transactions is an I-offender if it is not invariant-confluent. First,
pairs of operations are checked to see if a contradictory truth assignment is
formed (e.g. <code>Player(P) and not Player(P)</code>). Then, every pair of transactions
is considered. Given the weakest liberal precondition of the transactions, we
substitute the effects of the transactions into the invariant to get a formula.
We then check for the validity of the formula using Z3. If the formula is
valid, the transactions are invariant-confluent.</p>

<p><strong>Handling I-offender Sets.</strong>
There are two ways to handle I-offenders: invariant-repair and
violation-avoidance. Invariant-repair involves CRDTs; the bulk of this paper
focuses on violation-avoidance which leverages existing reservation and escrow
transaction techniques.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>UID generation.</em> Unique identifiers can easily be generated without
coordination. For example, a node can concatenate an incrementing counter
with its MAC address.</li>
<li><em>Multi-level lock reservation.</em> Locking is the most general form of
reservation. Locks come in three flavors: (i) shared forbid, (ii) shared
allow, and (iii) exclusive allow. Transactions acquire locks to avoid
invariant violation. For example, an <code>enrollTournament</code> could acquire a
<code>sharedForbid</code> lock on removing players, and <code>removePlayer</code> could acquire a
<code>sharedAllow</code> lock. Exclusive allow are used for self-conflicting operations.</li>
<li><em>Multi-level mask reservation.</em> If our invariant is a disjunction <code>P1 or ...
or Pn</code>, then to preserve the invariant, we only need to guarantee that at
least one of the disjuncts remains true. A mask reservation is a vector of
locks where an operation can falsify one of the disjuncts only after
acquiring a lock on another true disjunct preventing it from being
falsified.</li>
<li><em>Escrow reservation.</em> Imagine our invariant is <code>x &gt;= k</code> and <code>x</code> has initial
value <code>x0</code>. Escrow transactions allocate <code>x0 - k</code> <em>rights</em>. A transaction can
decrement <code>x</code> only after acquiring and spending a right. When <code>x</code> is
incremented, a right is generated. This gets tricker for invariants like <code>|A|
&gt;= k</code> where concurrent additions could generate too many rights leading to an
invariant violation. Here, we use <em>escrow transactions for conditions</em>, where
a primary is allocated for each reservation. Rights are not immediately
generated; instead, the primary is responsible for generating rights.</li>
<li><em>Partition lock reservation.</em> Partition locks allow operations to lock a
small part of an object. For example, an operation could lock part of a
timeline to ensure there are no overlapping timespans.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many ways to use reservations to avoid invariant violations. Indigo
uses heuristics and estimated operation frequencies to try and minimize
reservation acquisitions.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation.</strong>
Indigo can run over any key-value store that offers (i) causally consistency,
(ii) snapshot transactions with CRDTs, and (iii) linearizability within a data
center. Currently, it uses Swiftcloud. Its fault tolerance leverages the
underlying fault tolerance of the key-value store. Each reservation is stored
as an object in the key-value store, where operations are structured as
transfers to avoid some concurrency oddities.</p>
